# FactNorris JS
This is a Web App that I made for fun. It uses the public-api https://api.chucknorris.io/ to fetch fictitious facts about  *Walker Texas Ranger* star Chuck Norris. 

## Available Scripts

First of all, you shold go the project directory and run:

### `npm install`

Then, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
The app is ready to be deployed!
